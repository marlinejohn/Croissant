    <h1>ü•ê Welcome to Croissant world</h1>
    <p>
      Croissants are a style of viennoiserie pastries, which of course relates
      back to the Austrian city of Vienna, otherwise known as the birthplace of
      croissants. The ancestor to the modern-day croissant was called the
      kipferl, which dates back to the 13th century and comes in various shapes
      and sizes
    </p>
    <h2>Croissant Invention</h2>
    <p>
      The legends include tales that it was invented in Europe to celebrate the
      defeat of the Umayyad forces by the Franks at the Battle of Tours in 732,
      with the shape representing the Islamic crescent. <br />
      They made it in a crescent moon shape which was the symbol on the Ottoman
      flag. It was to remind everyone of their victory.
